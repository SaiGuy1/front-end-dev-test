### *Please also submit a small write up discussing (leave answers to a sentence or two):*

  1. What are they technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)

  <strong>For this project, I used React and React-Bootstrap because using React helped with reusability and modularizing my code. I used React-Bootstrap to enforce a grid system for the layout of my site. In my Index.js file, I have left clear comments to follow the flow of this site.</strong>

  2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose

    <strong>Even though React was very beneficial for reusability, I ran into many issues with CSS positioning of elements especially when transitioning to mobile. I figured using virtual widths and virtual heights along with bootstrap columns and rows would make for an easy transition to mobile, but I still had a lot of hurdles to figure out.</strong>

  3. What you enjoyed the most and why
    <strong>I enjoyed using React-Bootstrap because even though I am very comfortable with regular bootstrap, Bootstrap with components took some adjusting to. I was glad I was able to stick with it and finish this project.</strong>
